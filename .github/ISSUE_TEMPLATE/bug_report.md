<!-- Before creating a bug report, make sure you are using the latest version of Steam Rom Manager. -->
<!-- Nobody wants to try and figure out an issue on an old version where something may have already been fixed, and as such outdated versions are unsupported. -->

<!-- Support for usage of Steam Rom Manager and creating/using parsers do not belong here, support can be obtained via Discord. -->
<!-- Likewise if you are using SRM via Emudeck, seek support via their Discord as they ship their own preconfigured parsers with Steam Rom Manager that we do not provide support for. -->
